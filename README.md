# przm5_canopy_python
Move PRZM canopy fortran code to python 3. Sliders for input. Eventually would like to have all PRZM modules in Python 
and move the program to Google App Engine.
Source code for PRZM5 can be found at http://www.epa.gov/oppefed1/models/water/

Description of PRZM
From the PRZM Manual:
The objectives of this model development effort (By the Environment Protection Agency) were to provide a simulation package that can:
1) Simulate the transport and transformation of field-applied pesticides in the crop root zone and
the underneath unsaturated zone, taking into account the effects of agricultural management practices

2) Simulate the transport and transformation of nitrogen, introduced by atmospheric deposition and/or
septic systems in the crop root zone and the underneath unsaturated zone

3)Provide probabilistic estimates of potential exposure concentrations by taking into account the
variability in natural system, population and processes, and the uncertainty in out ability to quantify these properties and processes.
